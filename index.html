      <b>Miss Juliet</b> was a nice and caring form teacher. Though she never taught us but she always cared for us and told us the right things to do and she always encourage us to use what we have properly in order to be successful. Miss Juliet would always persuade us to do the right things and avoid doing the bad things that our teenage urges push us to do. This is one of the things that makes her a special form teacher.
      She also teaches us about teenage urges and the ways to avoid them.
